# MindConnect-Social-Platform-Business-Model
The platform “MindConnect” is for an audience that wants to go back to the basics of social media.

1. An attempt to remove the construct that what is popular is good and replace it with one-on-one human interaction
2. Reduce options and make it simpler to spend time on the internet
3. A platform that is truly focused on the customer and uses machine learning to optimize user experience rather than using 
    personal data to sell advertisement or exert influence
